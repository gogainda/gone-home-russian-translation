From the Desk of Richard Greenbriar Ph.D.\n\nDear Terrence,\nThank you for sending along a copy of your newly published book. An author's first published manuscript is a momentous occasion. I read it this afternoon. I certainly recognized my son in the subject matter. An author's work is the externalization of that which he holds dear (and that which he fears,) and in this respect I believe your work was successful. But the lens through which the personal shone was needlessly clouded by genre cliches and implausible dimestore science fictional dei ex machina. I congratulate you on the surviving the great ordeal that is publication, and rest assured that readers of your chosen genre will lap up copies hungrily. But I urge you to shed artifice.\n\nYou can do better.\n\nWith a father's love and encouragement,\nRichard Greenbriar Ph.D. = From the Desk of Richard Greenbriar Ph.D.\n\nDear Terrence,\nThank you for sending along a copy of your newly published book.
