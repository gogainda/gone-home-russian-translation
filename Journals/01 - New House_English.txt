Dear Katie,

So much has changed, even just since you've been gone. We moved into this house... I'm at a new school... and my big sister being GONE for a year doesn't make it any easier... 

It doesn't feel real. But I'm not going to let it phase me. I used to tell you everything, and if I can't do it in person because you're off gallivanting around who knows where, I'll tell it to this journal. Just like I was talking to you.
