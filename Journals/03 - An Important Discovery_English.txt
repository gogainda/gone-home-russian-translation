 You know that feeling, where the first moment you see someone it's like they have a big gold star around them, and you HAVE to get to know them?
 
 Well, there's this girl, I think she's a senior. She's usually dressed.. kind of punk. But sometimes I see her in this, like, army uniform? And she's always drawing in this notebook, looking so intense. I had no idea how I would ever, like, have an excuse to talk to her... 'Til I noticed she and her friends hang out and play Street Fighter at the 7-11 every day after school...
