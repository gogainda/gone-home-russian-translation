It's weird hanging out with girls. Daniel was around ever since I was little, and other girls... I dunno. But being around Lonnie is like... instantly just right. I gave her the grand Psycho House tour, and took my revenge on Super Nintendo, and it was like, I dunno, I finally found someone I feel normal around.

I drove her home and she gave me this tape and said "you have GOT to listen to this." I haven't stopped playing it since.
