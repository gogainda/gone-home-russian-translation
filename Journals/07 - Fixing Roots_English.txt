Lonnie brought her hair dye over today. She said, "I need to fix these roots. Think you could help?" Dyeing hair is weirdly intimate. I don't know if I've touched someone else's scalp before. That's pretty intimate, right? It felt intimate.

We looked into the mirror together after and I expected her to say something about how it looked crappy, or good or whatever. But that's when she said, "You're so beautiful." And she was looking at me.

Right in that moment, I wanted to say... something. But I waited, and the moment was gone.
