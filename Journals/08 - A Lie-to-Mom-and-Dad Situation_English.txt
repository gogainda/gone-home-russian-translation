Sometimes you just have to lie to mom and dad. Like when Lonnie asked me to see a band with her, and stay over at her friend's place in the city after. That's a lie-to-mom-and-dad situation.

But it was soooo worth it. The girls on stage were just so LOUD and REAL and AWESOME, and everybody was moving together like one huge tide of sound.

Between two songs Lonnie leaned over and said "how do you like your first show?" I was so happy I felt tears starting in my eyes, and then she up and hugged me. I think she could tell.
