At Todd's brother's place after the show, there was only a futon to sleep on, so Lonnie and I shared it. The lights went out... I was turned toward her... my eyes started to adjust, and then I could see she was looking at me, too. In the dark, she smiled.

My heart was beating so fast. I rolled over, I felt so... I don't know, nervous? After a minute she put her arm around me, and was so close, and whispered in my ear, "I really like you." I just nodded my head and I really hope she could tell. I really hope... that she meant what I think she did.

I've felt like a shook-up can of soda inside ever since. I hope we have a chance to talk before I explode.
