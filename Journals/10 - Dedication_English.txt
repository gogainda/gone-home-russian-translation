Lonnie had her going-away show with her band tonight. She's so incredible onstage... When she was singing, I could practically forget... everything...

That we only had 48 hours left...

That I don't know what comes next...

That I can't live without her.

Then, she dedicated the last song.. to me. And I couldn't take it. I was out on the curb behind the venue, sobbing til my ribs hurt. I would follow her anywhere, Katie. But I can't, where she's going.

After a long time she found me. She said she was sorry. She said, "I wish things could be different. I just wanted to make you happy."

I said, "I don't think you can anymore."
