Lonnie came over today. But everything was... different. She was sitting at my desk chair. And she wouldn't look at me.

Finally I asked her what was going on. She said she felt like she'd done something wrong that night in the city, like I must think...

But I said no, there was nothing wrong, I just wanted to say...

But I couldn't find the words. I felt like I was going to cry, but I wasn't sad. She got up and sat next to me on the bed. I looked at her.

"Lonnie... do you... think... you could ever..."

...And that's when she kissed me.
