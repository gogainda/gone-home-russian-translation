We agreed our last night together would be our happiest ever. That we'd forget tomorrow was going to come at all.

It worked for a while-- we had a good time seeing Oscar off, then ran up to the attic to look through our photos, to find one for Lonnie to take with her... and looking at them, I realized they were all in the past, and there wouldn't be any more, and I didn't know what I was going to do, and I cried, and she held me.

She said she knew it was hard, but life would move on.

I said I didn't want my life to keep moving without her.

That's when she cried too.

I was so exhausted, I must have fallen asleep like that, in her arms. In the morning, I woke up, and I was finally alone.
