The sunset light in this house is the saddest thing I've ever seen.

I just want to sleep.

When I'm in the attic, it almost feels like Lonnie could still be here... She's just downstairs... I'm just waiting to hear her pull down the hatch and come running up.

Maybe I'll go up to the attic... and wait...
