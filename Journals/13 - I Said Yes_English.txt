Oh my god Katie, I fell asleep in the attic, in Lonnie and my old spot, and I missed the first two calls. I ran down to catch the third one before the machine got it and it was LONNIE on a PAYPHONE. She'd been on the bus to Basic and she said she couldn't-- she couldn't think of anything but ME, and US, and that she couldn't go through with it, with the Army and being apart and ALL of it, that she got off the bus in SALEM. She said, "Sam, I want you to pack up everything you can and get in your car and come find me and let's just DRIVE... until we find somewhere... for us." And she asked me... if I could do that. And I said yes. Yes!
