Katie... I'm so sorry. That I can't be there to see you in person. That I can't tell you all this myself. But I hope, as you read this journal, and you think back... that you'll understand why I had to do what I did. And that you won't be sad and you won't hate me and you'll just know... that I am where I need to be.

I love you so much, Katie. I'll see you again. Someday.
