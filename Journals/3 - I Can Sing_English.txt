Todd's band lost their singer-- Todd says he sucked, Lonnie says he got sick of Todd's shit-- and he was complaining about needing a new singer, so Lonnie was like, "I can sing!" We were all kind of like, "you can??" And she was like, "probably!"

But she's been rehearsing with them for like a week now, and I finally got to see them play in Todd's basement today, and she's actually... really... amazing. I feel so... PROUD, when she's on stage. It's incredible being in awe of someone you love.

So everybody knows it's like, a temporary situation, til she ships out in June. But til then... I'm going to be at every single show.
