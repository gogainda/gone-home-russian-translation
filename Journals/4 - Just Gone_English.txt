I asked Lonnie what she had to do to get ready to ship out for Basic Training. She said, "not a lot, really. You're not allowed to bring anything with you-- you have no possessions, no contact with the outside world while you're in Basic. You just train hard every day. And then you deploy from there."

So... they'll just send her away. To who-knows-where. The other side of the country? The other side of the world?

My mind like, can't process it. That she's really going to be... gone.

Just gone.
