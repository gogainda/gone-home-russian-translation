They tell you to stick with the group on field trips, Katie. There's a reason for that.

Lonnie and I snuck off on the side paths at Multnomah Falls and got a little lost. Okay, a lot lost. Like, for hours.

But like RIGHT before the bus left, we found a trail, and came running down the path, soaked and covered in mud, shouting for the bus not to leave... 

The school called home... mom & dad said "you didn't get in trouble like this BEFORE you met that Lonnie girl..." but I don't think they KNOW-know. About us. The kids at school though... I'm really afraid that's a whole other story.

Stick with the group, Katie. Stick with the group.
