Katie, you know how mom & dad are. Not exactly... super open-minded. About things.

It feels like every minute I don't spend with Lonnie, I spend worrying about them finding out about us. And what would happen if they did...

You know dad's "joke" about "the nunnery" that he'd tell whenever you brought boys around the old house? I wonder where he would want to send ME...
