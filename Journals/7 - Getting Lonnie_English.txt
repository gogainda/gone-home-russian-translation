I don't "get" Lonnie sometimes.

Like, her band and our zine and her hair and everything are all "anti-authority," but I watch her in JROTC and she's doing drills in perfect formation, following orders, no question. And there's all the stuff in the news about Don't Ask Don't Tell. Like, she's going to join the Army and then have to... LIE? About who she IS? She said, "they don't need to know what they don't need to know." Like it was no big deal. This from the girl who trashed her locker to like, defend my honor...

I've learned when to stop arguing though. I don't think Lonnie even "gets" Lonnie sometimes.
