I had an... interesting talk with mom and dad tonight. One YOU'RE never going to need to have.

I mean... you've known, right? Like... I'VE known. I've known since like, She-Ra.

Mom and dad didn't, I guess.

But they saw the zine, and the stuff on the locker, and they were like, "is there something we should know about you and Lonnie?"

And so here's the thing. I was prepared for them to be mad, or disappointed, or start crying or something. But they were just in DENIAL. "You're too young to know what you want," "you and Lonnie are just GOOD FRIENDS," "you just haven't met the right BOY..." "It's a PHASE."

That's what I didn't see coming. That they wouldn't even... RESPECT me enough... to BELIEVE me.

Well. Joke's on them. Because they are in for one VERY long phase.
