Daniel finally came over to get his game. I'd been dreading it... but he brought this story with him that I wrote when we were little. I started reading it.. and then there I was, crying at the kitchen table. He asked what was wrong and I was thinking about how we used to be friends how much I'd taken for granted... but instead I told him about school and dad and Lonnie... and then how sorry I was that I wasn't his friend anymore.

He gave me a hug and said it was going to be okay. And for some reason, I almost believed him.
