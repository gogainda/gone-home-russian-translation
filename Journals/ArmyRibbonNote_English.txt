Hey! SAM!

You were asking what my JROTC ribbons meant. Here is a handy guide:

ORIENTEERING: This means the Army thinks I can find my way around.

RIFLE TEAM: The Army has branded me as a certified killing machine.

ADVENTURE TRAINING: I am a born adventuress and no borders can hold me. The Army recognizes this.

So if you didn't think I was cool before, now you do.
