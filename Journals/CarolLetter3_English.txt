First off:

 C O N G R A T U L A T I O N S ! ! ! ! !

"Janice Greenbriar, Regional Director!" And I say congratulations because, come on, you're going to take the job, right?! What are you waiting for, an engraved invitation!? Call them back!

But in the meantime, let's discuss this little outing you had with our favorite flannel-clad hunk! What a blast! But you sound like you're reading a lot into an innocent night out... you're sure there's something there? You said he has an out-of-town girlfriend... you're sure they're not serious?

Okay! So we have to figure out when we'll see each other next IN PERSON! Enough with the LETTERS! I owe you a congratulatory margarita, boss lady! SOON!

<3 Carol
