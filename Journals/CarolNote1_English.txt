Dear Jan,

It's so good to hear from you again! All this new house business sounds like quite the adventure! Remember the little dorm room we shared, freshman year? When we were miserable, fantasizing about our dream homes? I always said I wanted a mansion, you said you just wanted a house in the woods... Look who got both! Somebody up there likes you! I could use some of that magic. Send me some lotto numbers, I'll play them! Seriously!

But I shouldn't be complaining about this good old split-level we've had since Bob got transferred to Winnipeg. We just got new vinyl siding. Jealous yet? Let me know if you ever want to trade places...

So how are the girls doing? Has Katie left on her big European adventure yet? Speaking of jealous...

Write back soon! I miss you, roomie!
