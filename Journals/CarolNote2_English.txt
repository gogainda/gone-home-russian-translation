Dear Jan,

Oh honey, let me tell you, I understand how you feel. Bob and I have had our down periods. It's become a bit of a way of life, actually... You get used to each other, you live your own lives in the same house, the kids grow up, they go away... I'm sorry, this isn't helping, is it?! Don't worry. Terry will get over whatever's distracting him, things will go back to normal. And as for Sam being distant? That's a teenager for you. Nothing to worry about.

In the meantime though, this "controlled burn"-- that sounds like quite the adventure! But let's cut to the chase! This new ranger they sent, THAT'S what I want to hear about! "Ranger Rick?" You have to be kidding me! It's too perfect! You HAVE to tell me everything... and send pictures! I want the whole package! Wait, that sounded wrong!

Keep your chin up until Terry is out of his slump. And in the meantime, write more letters to your old friend Carol! She adores them!


Carol
