Dear Sam,

I'm SO happy you liked the drawing. I was thinking of us when I drew it. I knew you'd be able to tell. You'd love Mexico, I think, probably. The nature here is totally different than back hom. I keep thinking about Allegra and the first mate lost on a mysterious island where even the plants are out to get them... And then I think of them together, out there in the wilderness together.. and I start thinking of You Again...

I lie here in bed and I can almost feel you. I've been trying to save it up for when we're together again. I haven't done a good job, okay?! But I tried...

Okay, enough about that! Your last letter got to me the day before we start driving back north. We'll be racing this letter home! If I get home first, we can read it together! And YES, I'm taking tons of photos. We'll have to spend SO much time together in the darkroom.....!!!!!!!!!

tu amor, Lonnie
