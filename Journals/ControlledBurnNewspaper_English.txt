Controlled Burn Scheduled for Boon County

Plumes of smoke will rise above the northeastern region of Boon County over the better part of next week, as part of a Forestry Service-run controlled burn of overgrown sections of the Flintlock National Forest.

Forestry crews have been preparing the area for months. The burn operation will take place between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and possibly into Thursday depending on the speed of progress, according to the Forestry Service.

In addition to removing dead and overgrown vegetation that can lead to wildfires in the drier months, the operation will serve as a "valuable training tool" for the forestry and firefighting personnel involved, said Senior Conservationist Janice Greenbriar.
