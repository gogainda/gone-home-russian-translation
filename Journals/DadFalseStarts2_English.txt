John Russell's head swam. He felt incredibly drunk, despite not having touched a drop in hours. He vomited onto his feet. His bare feet. He stared for a moment, processing his sick-flecked toenails, scanning up his bare shins, bare knees... we was completely naked. He looked up and met the eyes of a gorgeous blonde woman wearing a tight polymer-fiber tunic. The fabric that strained at the seams to contain her generous bosom was emblazoned with the phrase "MATTER TRANSFERENCE OPERATOR." Then he passed out.
