Terry!

Hey man, how have you been? I know you're a published author and everything now, but my editor at HiFi Aficianado has too much review work to go around, and he's looking for another freelancer. Naturally I thought of you. You were saying in your last letter how much of a pain it's been trying to find a publisher for your latest work of literature, and writing stereo reviews is dead simple. Sit at home with a glass of scotch, listen to some records and write up how it sounds. And then get paid.

I've included some issues of the mag to use as examples. If you're interested, send some writing samples to my editor. And tell him your old college chum Mike sent you! Here's the address:

David Cupping
Reviews Editor, HiFi Aficianado Magazine
88 Downing St. Suite 4
NY NY 10014


Do it!

Mike
