Dear Terrence,

David asked me to write you regarding the reviews you've been submitting the last few months. Frankly they're becoming more trouble than they're worth from an editing standpoint. There's a word limit-- it's your job to stay under it, not mine to cut back to it. Even then it's becoming harder and harder to weed out the tangents and non sequiturs from the usable copy without heavy rewrites. The readers of Home Theater Aficianado want to hear about the quality and value of the hardware, not ruminations on your childhood!

David's known you for a long time, and he's the boss, so I'm giving you one more shot on his say-so. You should write him a nice note thanking him for his patience and generosity. Look through your old stuff and start submitting reviews like that again. Then everybody will be happy.
