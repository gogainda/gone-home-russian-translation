Electrical Inspection Form

The wiring in the house is technically up to all safety and amperage requirements. However multiple layers of wiring have been added into structure over the last 100 years. System is frequently unpredictable. Lights blink out for no clear reason Pressure on floorboards and doorframes disrupts circuits wired directly behind the surface. Properly reworking the electrical system would be highly destructive to the walls, floor and fixtures of the structure.

After discussion with Mr. Greenbriar, since there are no current safety concerns, these issues will not be addressed.
