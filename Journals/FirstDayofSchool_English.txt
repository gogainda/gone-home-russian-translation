Welcome, new student! We hope that you are as excited about your first day at Goodfellow High School as we are! Please be sure to bring the following with you on your first day of classes, so that you can get right into the swing of things.

-One sturdy folder, with pockets, for each of your six class periods
-One lined notebook per period, or one large notebook with six divided sections
-At least six pens (blue or black ink) and six pencils
-One box of colored pencils
-A standard combination lock for your assigned locker
-A nutritious lunch, or $2.50 for a lunch provided by the school cafeteria
-A positive attitude!

Please remember to get plenty of sleep the night before and be ready for the first bell to ring at 8:00 AM. See you soon, and again, welcome.

Beth Valence, Principal
