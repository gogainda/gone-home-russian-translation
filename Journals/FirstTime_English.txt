It's like a drug...

The first time was in my room in the middle of the night. I woke up and Lonnie was kissing me. The clock said 3:13. Her face was spectral in its dim red light. Then I could nly feel her. It was different than any time I'd done it myself. My head was swimming, I felt disembodied, transported bodily, like being caught in a powerful current, having no control and wanting none. It broke and I didn't want anything but it again... like a drug...

Strategy:

Sleepovers are good but there have been close calls
The basement is good but cold and smells
My car is good but riskier still, and cramped...

Someday we won't have to sneak around anymore
