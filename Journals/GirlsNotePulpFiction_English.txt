Hey Sam do you want to see Pulp Fiction after school at the Colliseum. It came out last weekend and Todd won't shut up about it so it's either good or we can make fun of him for liking it.

My mom is supposed to cook dinner for us tonight for a change, but I can just ditch out on it probably. What time? Also isn't that movie supposed to be really violent? Am I going to barf?

According to Todd it is pretty hardcore. I guess Uma Thurman gets stabbed in the heart with a heroin needle so that's kind of hilarious. Also something about cheeseburgers is important. I think Todd's going to come so he can see it again if that's okay. 7:15. Okay? Don't barf.

Alright see you then!
