Hi Lonnie!

So if you wanted to come over to my house still this afternoon that would be cool! I can drive. It's kind of far but I can drive you home too so hopefully that's fine. Write back and leave this in my locker if you still want to and we can meet in the parking lot after 6th.

YEAH I am totally in! See you there. Then I'm gonna kick you're butt. Get ready!!
