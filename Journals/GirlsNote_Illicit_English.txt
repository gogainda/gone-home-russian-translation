LONNIE! My parents are leaving town so we'll have the run of the whole house til you leave! Imagine actually spending the night in my room instead of sneaking to our usual spot in the attic. Not that the attic doesn't have its musty allure but my bedroom is warmer.

SAM!! We should defile your parent's bed while they're gone! That'll show em!!

LONNIE! You are gross. Never change. --Sam
