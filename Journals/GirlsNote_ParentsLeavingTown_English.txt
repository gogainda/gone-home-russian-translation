I wish I knew how to explain it better. The Army is this thing I grew up with. It's part of me. My dad's Army friends are like, family. I've always known it was where I'd end up. I'd never thought of it any other way... I wish things could be different...

Maybe someday, when I'm settled at a base, and you're done with college, and you're a famous writer and I can rebuild a tank engine with my eyes closed... things will be different. And we can be together.

Until then,
