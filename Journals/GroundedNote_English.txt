Sam--

Since you refused to hear us out this afternoon, your mother and I are putting this in writing so that we are absolutely clear.

You are grounded for the rest of the month from social and telephone privileges and from using your car for anything but going to and from school. We understand what you are going through, but we can't allow you to continue with this kind of behavior at school. And clearly, once your privileges are reinstated, we can't allow you to have your bedroom door closed while Lonnie is at the house.

This is the last word on the matter. Get back on course so this won't have to happen again.


Dad
