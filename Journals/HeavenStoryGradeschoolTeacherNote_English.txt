Dear Mrs. Greenbriar,

I'd like to talk to you about the stories that Samantha has been writing lately. They are what I'd expect from the little boys in class, which along with a few other tendencies I've observed brings me a bit of concern. Please call the school as soon as you can so that we can schedule a brief parent-teacher meeting.

Thank you,

Karen Brown
