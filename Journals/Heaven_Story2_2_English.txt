Allegra and her scouting party peered down warily through the dense canopy of rustling leaves from their perch high in the forest's branches. Mere feet away, sunlight shone brightly off the inner ice walls of the glacial basin in which the forest grew. It was a strange sight indeed, such lushness juxtaposed with the frigid ice formations.

Allegra leapt forward without hesitation, bounding through the high branches. The First Mate had been captured by the Green Glacier's Amazonian tribe. His life hung in the balance. "We have to hurry!" Her party followed behind, moving quietly as a breeze through the greenery.

Allegra landed in the clearing and shouted, "Stop!!" She saw the queen Amazonian, up on her pedestal, reaching for the lever that would drop her First Mate into the vat below. She shouted, "No!!!" and flung her saber at the Amazon's reaching hand, but it was to late. The First Mate screamed as he fell toward the water, then splashed down, and all was eerily silent. Allegra looked on, frozen in fear and remorse. She had been a moment too late.
