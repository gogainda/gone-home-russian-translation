Captain Allegra, still in her flowing skirt and sturdy jerkin, descended the single shining thread into the lower cavern of the labyrinth. She and the First Mate, on their own now, grew closer to their goal: the throneroom of the dead immortal King of the island. The First Mate slid down the line onto the stone floor. She swept chalky bone dust from the front of her canvas trousers and looked up at Allegra.

The silken thread, nigh unbreakable thanks to the enchanted moths that inhabited the island, trailed behind, leading their way back to the entrance. From further into the labyrinth, a moaning began to echo. The moaning grew louder and clearer. The King's cursed voice. The hairs on Captain Allegra's arms stood on end. She looked back at the First Mate, whose eyes remained locked on the blackness of the passage for a moment too long before noticing the Captain's gaze. The First Mate nodded silently ahead.
