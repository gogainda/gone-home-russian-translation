Mate tied the shining thread to the belt of her trousers, gave a quick salute and a wink, and dashed off.

Allegra waited, staring vigilantly across at the top of the stairs where the First Mate was to appear. The King continued his-- wait, no. No! The singing stopped. The King turned and began walking up the stairs! Allegra wanted to call out, to do anything to stop the First Mate from running head-first into danger. The King was nearly at the top of the stairs when the First Mate burst through the passageway. She skidded to a stop, then turned and ran, the King chasing after with distressing speed.

From some dank passage much too far away, Allegra heard the First Mate's scream. The line in Allegra's hand went taut, then shuddered. It felt slack to the stone floor. Allegra ran, following the line, and came to its end: the unbreakable thread dangled limply, its end frayed in her hand. She tossed it to the ground and ran, ran, ran.
