It's different now. I mean, we still hang out all the time like before. But now when nobody else is around... well, you know. So you COULD say we're dating. But it's secret. Secret dating? I don't know. I mean I guess that's the real difference: now, when we get off the phone, or go home for the night... or it's just quiet and we're alone... we say "I love you."
