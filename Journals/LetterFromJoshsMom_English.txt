Janice,

Thank you for having Danny over to your new home. He has missed having his friend Samantha in the neighborhood very much. 

Danny asked if he could lend Samantha his Nintendo Street Fighting tape and I gave my permission. He needs to spend less time with those games anyway. No hurry returning it.

Let Samantha know that she is welcome back to our house to visit anytime.


Sincerely,

Mary Schutes
