Hello Terrence,

I write on what I hope and imagine must be a joyous occasion. News reaches me that you are newly married to a wonderful young woman. I have had more than a little time, during my long days and nights at the house on Arbor Hill, to consider my past and my family, and my thoughts have often lingered on your development and welfare in the ten years since we last met. Your marriage gives me much reassurance in this regard.

I wish you and your new bride many happy years together. You are always welcome on Arbor Hill, though I will understand of course if you feel you cannot accept this invitation.


Yours very sincerely,

Oscar Masan
