Hey Lonnie, sorry my mom was such a bitch last night. She's hardly ever around since her forest is like an hour away and then when she is home she takes it out on you, like because you're not a member of the family she knows you won't call her on it, and I'm sorry.

Ha ha, it's okay, I know she's just jealous of our cool and freewheeling lifestyles. I feel sorry for YOU-- I'm lucky, my mom lives in Florida. You have to have a mom EVERY DAY

Sorry, I didn't mean to bring up the mom thing like that. I know, I shouldn't complain.

No I'm being totally serious. My mom is a psycho Christian and her new husband ("DON") is a complete tool. Living in Florida with him is her eternal punishment in my mind.

So you wouldn't rather live with your mom in Florida?
