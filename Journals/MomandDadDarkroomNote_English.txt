Mom & Dad,

This coming week you may notice I spend a lot of time going up to the darkroom in the attic. My Photography class final project is SUPER INTENSIVE (involving many complex & delicate chemical processes) and so you will probably not see a lot of me for a while. But PLEASE if you need me BE SURE TO KNOCK and WAIT FOR ME TO OPEN THE ATTIC DOOR because otherwise my final project might be ruined, I could fail the class, never graduate high school, become addicted to hard drugs, etc. etc.

THANK YOU!!!

-Samantha
