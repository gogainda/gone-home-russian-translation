Masan's Pharmacy Changes Hands

The shoppers of Main Street were surprised today at the announcement that Masan's Pharmacy would change ownership for the first time since it opened, 10 years ago.
Rumors swirled that the sudden sale of the pharmacy was transacted for a song. When asked about speculation that the deal had been signed for as little as one dollar, Mr. Samuel Onsteen, Oscar Masan's longtime assistant and now proprietor of Masan's Pharmacy, told the Register, "The specifics will remain between myself and Mr. Masan." Mr. Masan has taken sick, and was unavailable for comment.
