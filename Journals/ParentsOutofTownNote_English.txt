Sam-

You mother and I will be away for a long weekend celebrating our anniversary June 3-7. We will be camping in the gorge but we will give you a call on the way home.

Sorry the kitchen is still mid-renovation. Never trust a contractor. $40 is on the table to order pizza while we're gone.

Be good.
