Ranger Patermach has been indispensible during the course of the prescribed burn preparation and execution. I believe his experise and dedication has been the deciding factor in the success of a very complex and challenging conservation effort.
In the opinion of the Flintlock Forest staff, Rick's contributions to daily operations have become essential to the outfit's continuing success. To this end I will be formally submitting paperwork requesting his permanent reassignment to this facility.
