TO: Samantha Greenbriar
FROM: Principal Sheldon Grossman

Dear Miss Greenbriar,

I appreciate the time and effort you put into writing your letter. It showed initiative and was well written. But it does not change my mind on this matter. While I understand that Miss DeSoto is a friend of yours, the fact of the matter is that she defaced school property with profanity. The fact that she allegedly defaced her own locker in retaliation for another student doing the same to yours is immaterial.

As to your complaint that no other student has been punished for their part in this incident, the fact is that no guilty party has come forward, and there has been no convincing evidence as to who might have defaced your locker. In other words, there is no one to punish. I would suggest letting this issue drop, as it will only bring more unwanted attention on yourself, which I believe is what you claim began this whole incident in the first place.

Sincerely,
Principal Sheldon Grossman
