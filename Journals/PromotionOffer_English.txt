OFFER OF PROMOTION

Dear Head Conservationist Greenbriar,

Due to your exemplary management of the Flintlock Prescribed Burn operation last year, and the Service's need for experienced personnel to direct regional operations, we would like to offer you the position of Regional Conservation Management Director, responsible for operations throughout northwestern Oregon.

Your post would no longer be the Flintlock National Forest; instead you would work in the Regional Management Office, located at 128 Bullhorn Rd. Your assistance would be sought in selecting a ranger to fill your former post.

Please respond as soon as possible regarding your decision. We very much look forward to your reply.

Signed,
Bruce Pendleton
