REED COLLEGE, one of the nation's most lauded private liberal arts and sciences universities, is proud to announce its 14th annual Summer Program for Young Scholars. This program invites students of grade 10 and 11 to attent lectures, workshops, and discussions covering a wide variety of intellectual pursuits. By focusing on small-group sessions and close faculty-student interactions, the program encourages young minds to thoroughly explore areas of growth and enrichment as they approach the threshold of higher education.

Beyond the benefits of the program itself, three students from each track will be offered a full scholarship for their first year at Reed, if they decide to attend the university full-time as undergraduates and are accepted by Reed's admissions board. 

Educators at students' schools have been provided with documentation outlining the specific requirements for each track and processes for submitting portfolios and applications. Students accepted to the program will be notified at the beginning of calendar year 1995
