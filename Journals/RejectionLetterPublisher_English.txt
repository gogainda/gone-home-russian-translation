From the Desk of
Donald Fripps, Publisher
Mercury Books Inc.


March 8, 1976

To Mr. Terrence Greenbriar,

I write to inform you that unfortunately Mercury Books will be unable to publish your followup to The Accidental Pariah. Despite the low sales of The Accidental Savior, we went ahead with publication of the second book in hopes of the John Russell series "catching on." However, sales of the second book have in fact been lower than those of the first, and so our stewardship of the series must end here.

It has been a pleasure working as your publisher, and we wish you, and John Russell, the best in your future endeavors.


Sincerely,

Donald Fripps,
Publisher, Mercury Books Inc.
