Dear Mr. Greenbriar,

First let me say that I hope this missive finds you well-- hell, it feels like a goddam miracle that it finds you at all! Do you know how long we've been trying to track you down?! Worry not, we aren't the Feds, the men in black, or any other sort of creeping fascist hobgoblins. In fact we're on your side. Let me start from the beginning.

Unknown Dimension is what you might call a Specialist publishing house-- we traffic in the weird, the ahead-of-its-time, the lost-but-not-forgotten-by-a-small-but-dedicated-group-of-plugged-in-bibliophiles type of out-there mass-market-shunning visionary expression that refuses to be taken on anything but its own terms.

We've had an unparalleled run since our inception four years ago, unearthing and reviving, Christ- (or Zombie-)like, timeless works such as N.N. Bestman's Message of the Snakemen, IT'S INSIDE ME! by Jens Keller, and Emil Krieger's oft-banned Venusian Fleshtraders.

But ever since we discovered tattered copies of your "ACCIDENTAL" series at a church rummage sale in Long Branch, NJ, we've been trying to track down the author of this weird and dark American outsider art.
