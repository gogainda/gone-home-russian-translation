John Russell, mild mannered insurance agent by day, reckless history-revising sociopath by night, is the twisted peacekeeper that modern Suburban America deserves. It is our mission to bring him back to life.

We want your permission to reprint the work, since your original publisher, Mercury Books, folded a decade ago. We want you to supply a new foreward for the books, to appear in brand new editions of THE ACCIDENTAL SAVIOR and THE ACCIDENTAL PARIAH, to be produced by Unknown Dimension as a limited run and marketed directly to our highly discerning customer base.

WE LOOK FORWARD TO EMBARKING WITH YOU, And to thrusting your work screaming back into the sweating palms of an unsuspecting American public. It's about time.

Blast off,
KAZ
