Hi Terry,

Enclosed please find a Pioneer CLDD703 unit, with remote and cables. We need a half-page review for the October issue, so that gives you about two weeks to get us the copy for edit. Standard stuff like you gave us on the CLDD502. It's a combi player so check its CD playback with a few discs as well as laserdisc and they want us to definitely hit the signal-to-noise ratio and TOSLINK stuff for high-end buyers.

Looking forward to your take on it. Enjoy the unit.


Dave
