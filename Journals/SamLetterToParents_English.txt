TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

I, Samantha Greenbriar, am Seventeen years old, and am therefore an independent, fully functional human being.

The fact that you still forbid me from going into the city on my own is, frankly, absurd. Compare with Katie, who is only three years older than me and yet you allowed her to go ALL THE WAY ACROSS AN OCEAN TO ANOTHER CONTINENT on her own.

I just want spend an evening in a normal totally safe city ON MY OWN like a HUMAN BEING and since you may ALSO remember that I have my own car now, you CAN'T REALLY STOP ME. 

Warmest regards,

Your daughter Samantha
