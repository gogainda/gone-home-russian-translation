The Menstrual Cycle

An ovum starts to develop.
While the ovum is developing, the lining of the uterus is getting thick and soft.
The ovary releases the ovum.
It travels through the fallopian tube.
If the egg does not meet a sperm, it dissolves.
About two weeks later, since the lining of the uterus is not needed for a pregnancy, it comes out through the vagina.
Another ovum starts to develop in one of the ovaries and the process begins again.
It is incredible how the female body knows how to prepare for pregnancy!
