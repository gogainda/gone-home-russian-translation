I'm so stupid sometimes.

I was telling Lonnie that I got into my college summer program thing, and I was all making plans like, you should come visit me! Stay in my dorm room! But she said, "Sam... I ship out on June 6th." I was like... ship out? To where? She said, "to Basic Training! What did you think I was doing all that ROTC stuff for??" I guess she's been planning to join the army right after high school since she was like, 12. And I guess she's really going to do it.

So I was like, "after graduation, I'm just... never going to see you again?"

She said, "let's just have fun while we can."
