NAME: Samantha Greenbriar
YEAR: 11
TEACHER: Fletcher
PERIOD: 5
SUBJECT: Shop I
ASSIGNMENT: Metalworking - Engraving
GRADE: C-

NOTES: Not a challenging assignment, metal plaque for family portrait reasonable subject but not complex, when I said that "mom" and "dad" should be replaced with parents names I did NOT mean just add them underneath.

Acceptable leveling on edges. Show more pride in work.
