Sighting Journal

Aug 31 1994 1:19AM - A TALL SHADOW in the upstairs hall. When I rounded the corner, no one was there. How tall was Uncle Oscar? (Note: I was not wearing my glasses.)

Sept 3 1994 12:44AM - A faint voice coming from the bottom of the stairs. I said "hello." Did not investigate. Probably was the furnace.

Sept 9 1994 4:11PM -

Poured milk from carton in fridge. It was spoiled. Pretty sure I read that spirits can sour milk. (Milk was just bought YESTERDAY.)
