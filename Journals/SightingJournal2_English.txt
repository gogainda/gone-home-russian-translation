Sept 20 1994 11:24PM - Lonnie says she feels a "presence" in the TV room. I suddenly begin to feel cold. We build a protective pillow fort.

Oct 1 1994 11PM-12AM - Lonnie and I employ Ouija board as a medium. Disturbing messages are conveyed from the other side. Oscar definitely here!

Oct 8 1994 10PM - Oct 9 4AM - Enlisted Lonnie to stay up all night and help patrol premises, recording any signs of otherworldly presence. Lonnie reported many sightings, but all remained unconfirmed. Possible ectoplasm in attic probably due to leaky roof. Sample taken just in case. Despite our best efforts we both fell asleep around 4AM. All in all a successful night.
