Dear Samantha,

I would like to cordially thank you for having me to your abode for the Thanksgiving holiday with your lovely family. I enjoyed the flavorful potatoes and also it was weird being around your parents for that long but it was pretty funny how impossible it is for your dad not to be awkward for more than 30 seconds at a time.

Very cordially yours,

Your close friend and confident,

Lonnie D
