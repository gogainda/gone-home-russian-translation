Oscar Masan, 60, of Boon County, died peacefully last month in his home.

Mr. Masan was born on September 8, 1933, in the house that would be his home for the rest of his life. He attained his degree in pharmacy at a young age, and returned to Boon County. He quickly became a well-loved figure at the center of the community.

In the decades preceding his passing he was seldom seen outside his home. A service will be held this Sunday at the First Methodist Church at 1:00 PM. All are welcome.

His survivors include his nephew, Terrence Greenbriar, as well as, in spirit, the people of Boon County, to whom he provided wellness and comfort.
