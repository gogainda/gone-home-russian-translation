Will and Testament of Oscar Masan

I, Oscar Masan, possessing full competence of mind and memory, and after full survey of valued items to my name, do hereby declare this my Last Will and Testament. The following shall hold true upon my passing:

1. I declare that I am a lifelong resident of Boon County; that I am unmarried and have no children.

2. I declare I have no outstanding debts to my name, to any creditors, living or dead.

3. I do hereby bequeath every item of value of which I may die possessed, including the dwelling and surrounding acres located at 1 Arbor Hill, as well as any and all personal property and monied accounts, to Terrence L. Self, Jr., of Ellis County.

In the event that said Terrence L. Self, Jr. should predecease me, then and in such event, the bequest to him shall fall and the same is bequeathed to his children as ordered by age and competence as stewards of the estate.

I subscribe my name to this Will this 13 day of August, 1973, at the offices of the Boon County Court Registrar.

Oscar Masan
