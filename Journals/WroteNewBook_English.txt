From the pen of Terrence L. Greenbriar

Dear Kaz,

I can't tell you what a joy it is to see John Russell back in print. Thank you very much for sening along copies of the new editions. The cover art is really something!

I know you've said that Unknown Dimension isn't in the business of printing new material, but this revived interest in my work has brought on a wave of inspiration, resulting in a manuscript that complete John Russell's journey, which I think you may find intriguing. It is reflective and introspective, without forgetting the excitement and "weirdness" that Unknown Dimension readers expect.

I hope this might be an exciting new direction for Unknown Dimension to pursue. At the very least, I am grateful that John Russell's adventures didn't come to an end quite when I thought they had.

My thanks and regards,
Terrence L. Greenbriar
